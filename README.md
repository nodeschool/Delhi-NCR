Node school chapter for nodeschool@intellimeet

For the curious ones wondering what intellimeet is : 
Intellimeet is an event that is currently for our office members, targeted to have a day wide programming mash up on various new technologies.


This event is right now limited to programmers at our office @Intelligrape Software Pvt Ltd. After this event we plan to launch it for other programmers.

Further guidelines will be published in a few days.
